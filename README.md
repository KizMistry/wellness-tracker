# 🧠 Wellness Tracker

A full-stack **mood and wellness tracking app** where users can log moods, filter by date ranges, visualize emotional trends, and export their data as CSV files.

This project showcases **frontend (React + Tailwind)**, **backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)**, and **database (PostgreSQL)** skills, along with **data analytics features**, **charting**, and **full deployment to the cloud**.

## 🧠 Why I Built This
This project demonstrates:

- End-to-end full-stack development (React → Flask → PostgreSQL).

- Data handling and analytics with visual charts.

- A production-ready, fully deployed app.

I wanted to create a project that’s practical, visually engaging, and shows my ability to combine frontend interactivity with backend logic and database management.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
